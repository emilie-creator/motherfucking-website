        <h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website</h1>
        
        <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
</p>
        <p> <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this <br> shit.

 </h2>  

</p>
<p> <h3> 7 fucking declarations.                                                              

</h3></p>

<p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read <br> masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass <br> website: <br>
 - Shit's <em> still</em> lightweight and loads fast <br>
 - <em>Still</em>  fits on all your shitty screens <br>
- <em> Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers <br>
- The motherfucker's <em> still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site <br>
-  Shit's <em>still </em>  legible and gets your fucking point across <br>
</p>
    
    <p> <h3> And guess what, motherfucker:

</h3></p>
<p> You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.

</p>

<p> <h2> Let it breathe
 </h2>
</p>

<p> Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not <br> 
married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <br> 
<code> line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see <br> 
that...piss off.
</p>

<p> If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? <br>
Yes? What a shitty book. </p>

<p> <h2> A little less contrast

</h2></p>

<p> Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a <br>
bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so <br>
focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

<p> <h2> Size Matters

</h2></p>
<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to  <br>
16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen. </p>

<p> <h2> Line-width, motherfucker

</h2></p>

<p> Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's  <br> 
200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more <br> 
than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
</p>

<p> <h2> Yes, this is <em> also </em> fucking satire, you fuck </h2></p>

<p> I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com"> this site's inspiration </a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so <br>
simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, <br>
high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web  <br> 
designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
