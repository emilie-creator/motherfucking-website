        <title> The Best Motherfucking Website</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1> This is the <em> best</em> motherfucking website. </h1>
        
        <p> Really, it is. </p>
        <p> <h2> Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?

</h2></p>

<p> You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <br>
<span class="motherfuckingwebsite"> motherfuckingwebsite</span> (.com) <br>
is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. <br> 
You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
</p>

<p> <span class="wrong"> WRONG</span>, motherfucker.

</p>

<p> <h2> The best kick-ass website

</h2> </p>

<p> Let me describe the <em> real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="motherfuckingwebsites"> motherfuckingwebsites </span> :</p>

<p>  - Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed) <br>
     - The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com">Google home page</a> <br>
     - Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi) <br>
     - Looks <em> almost </em> the same on every screen <br>
     -Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small> well, kind of </small> <br>
     - It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"> accessible </a>, so everyone can enjoy it  <small> but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small><br>
     - Shit is <em> even more </em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"> ARPANET</a> website <br>
     - Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"> IPoAC</a> <br>
     - Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <small> which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf </small> <br> 
     - It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or <br>
      any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla! <br>
     - Doesn't include any tracking service <small> this website does, but hey, who cares </small> <br>
     -Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em> JUST USE IT </em> <br>
     - Use <em> some </em> fucking <span class="colored"> colors</span> <br>
     - Links don't really need to keep that <span class="shitty"> shitty blue </span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="violetish"> violetish color </span> <br>
      when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa"> nice color</a> .

</p>
<p> <h2> Well guess what, motherfucker:

</h2></p>

<p> This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"> guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com"> guy before him. </a> g

</p>

<p> Why? </p>

<p> - It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS"> secure connection </a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be <br>
 different for everyone, pshht!). <br>
    - It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain"> gTLDs</a> available out there: .website <br>
    - It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com"> domainr</a> to do something cool too. <br>
    - It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org"> Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?) <br>
    -It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com"> nginx</a> : the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server <br>
    -It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"> a custom version </a> of the awesome <a href="https://jquery.com"> ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <b> /s</b> <br>
    - It doesn't use a single media query <small>well, not really </small> <br>
    - It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is <br> outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/office/aide-d-internet-explorer-23360e49-9cd3-4dda-ba52-705336cc0de2?ui=fr-FR&rs=fr-FR&ad=FR"> the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/"> a much cooler browser </a> <br>
    -It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 <br>
    - It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2"> HTTP/2 </a> <br>
    -It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the <br>
     website more than once <br>
    - It uses <a href="https://piwik.org"> Piwik </a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us) <br>
    - It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org"> CORS </a> <br>
    - It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php"> Accessible </a> <br>
    - It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/"> Github </a>, and everybody can contribute to it. <br>
    - It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License </a> , which is pretty clear on what you <br>
     can and what you can't do:

<p class="fakepre"> 0 You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO. </p>

<p> <h2> Put even less contrast </h2></p>

<p> Yeah, a 
      <b>  #444 is cool</b> but a <b> #454545 is better.
</b> 

</p>

<p> We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="motherfuckingwebsite"> motherfuckingwebsite </span> .

</p>

<p> <h2> Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate

</h2></p>

<p> Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 <br>
 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.

</p>

<p> <h2> Put some pictures

</h2></p>

<small> A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</small>
</p>

<p> We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a <span class="motherfuckingwebsite"> motherfuckingwebsite </span> so include some pictures to give a context.</p>

<p> The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
<p> You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.
</p>

<p> <h2> Yes, even this is satire.

</h2></p>

<p> But this doesn't mean you should load your  <span class="motherfuckingwebsite"> motherfuckingwebsite </span> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, requests (with a small size) = faster load time!</p>

<p> "Good design is as little design as possible." <br>
    - <em> <small> Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com
</em></small> 
</p>

<p> That's not entirely true, look at that <span class="motherfuckingwebsite"> motherfuckingwebsite </span>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.

</p>

<p> <h2> Epilogue

</h2></p>

<p> Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com"> motherfuckingwebsite </a>  and the <br> <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"> bettermotherfuckingwebsite. </a>

</p>

<p> Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even <br> though this is still <span class="thebestmotherfuckingwebsite"> thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span> ), so go check 'em out.

</p>

<p> Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" <small>  Cit. needed

</h2></p>

<p> The cat picture was taken from the cool <a href="https://pixabay.com"> Pixabay </a> website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka <br> Public Domain) content. The author is <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/1899441-1899441/">1899441 </a>  (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old picture</a>  <br> was by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt </a> , but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute.
